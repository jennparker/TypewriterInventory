# typewriter-love
I love old manual typewriters. I also love things written in typewriter fonts. This purpose of this app is to inventory my typewriters, 
compile a list of cool typewriter-related references and brush up on my Android best practices. Eventually, I'd love to 
mess around with some cool animations and transitions. This is a work in progress.
